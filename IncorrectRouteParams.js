In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating to a route that requires parameters but doesn't receive them correctly. This often leads to unexpected behavior or errors within the component rendered at that route.  For instance, if a route is defined as `/users/:userId` and a user attempts to navigate to `/users` without providing a userId, the component at `/users/:userId` might fail to render correctly or throw errors.
